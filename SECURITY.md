## Reporting a Vulnerability

We care about the security of everyone's information, but not everyone is perfect at catching every single security risk.

If you find one:
1. Go to the issues
2. For **title** name the security problem
3. For **message** be very descriptive of the problem, if you have a screenshot of the problem, use it.
4. **Label** the issue with the _Security_ tag
5. We will take a look and make changes for feature updates!
