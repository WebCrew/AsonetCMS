# Creating themes

Creating a theme is pretty easy all you have to do is the steps below.

1. Go to the _/themes_ folder
2. Copy and paste the default theme which is named _asonet_
3. Rename it to whatever you name your theme.
4. Modify the `config.xml` file to the following code
```xml
<config type="theme">
    <name>{theme_name}</name>
    <author>{author}</author>
    <date>{mm/dd/yy HH:ii:ss}</date>
    <version>{theme_version}</version>
    <!--Ignore this-->
    <active></active>
</config>
```
5. All to do now is modify the files.
